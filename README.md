# WIE-SP Food@Home

The idea is to create a website where you can search recipes and then get the ingredients delivered to your doorstep. To use this service, you need to login with your individual profile. Every recipe has a video tutorial to make your cooking experience fun and easy. The ingredients can be customized to fit your taste and get delivered right your home with the exact measurements so that no food is wasted.
